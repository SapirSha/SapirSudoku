# Î© Sudoku Solver

# About the project
This is a sudoku solver, that solves the following sudokus:
1X1, 4X4, 9X9, 16X16, 25X25,
6X6, 8X8, 10X10, 12X12, 14X14, 15X15, 16X16, 18X18, 20X20, 22X22, 24X24.

The sudoku gives **all** the possible answers to the sudoku (depending on choice).

**Disclaimer:** while the program itself can differentiate between rectangle sudokus with horizontal and vertical grids and can solve both, since they cant be differentiated in the input, only horizontal( which is the most common one ) is used.

# Input
You can input the sudokus from the console, or by giving the console a path to a text file with the sudoku.

In case of file input, the sudoku determines if a line is a sudoku(see "determining-the-input") and solves it, or when multiple lines are detected it will solve all of them.

Exiting the program can be done by using (ctrl + c), (ctrl + z) or the input sapir.


# Sudoku input format
A Sudoku puzzle is represented as a string, where each character corresponds to a cell in the grid. The character '0' represents an empty cell, while any character with an ASCII value greater than '0' represents a digit. The numerical value of a character is determined by its distance from '0' in the ASCII table. For example, '1' represents 1, '9' represents 9, and ':' (ASCII 58) represents 10 (Because '0' is ASCII 48).

# Determining the input
The program determines whether the input is a file path or a Sudoku puzzle based on the following criteria:
A string is considered a Sudoku if all its ASCII values fall within the allowed range of Sudoku values, with a deviation of +-10. In other words, each character's ASCII value must be between (0 - Deviation) and (root of length of the input + Deviation).
A string is considered a file path if it ends with ".txt". 
And if neither condition is met, the input is considered invalid.

# Output
The program outputs solved sudokus in the same format as the input(see "Sudoku input format") and the human readable sudoku form.
when looking at file outputs, the string format of the sudoku will be printed both in the file the sudoku appears at and in the console, while the human readable will only be printed in the console.
the program will also output the time it took to get to the first solution.

# How the algorithm works
The sudoku revolves around backtracking and uses hidden groups, pointing groups, and naked singles as heuristics.
it also uses a stack to return to previous positions in case of backtracking.

There are quite a lot of structures the algorithem uses and here are some:

**Notice:** Bitset is a data structure i created that uses an array of ints and their bits to store positive natural values (some sort of a set). this data structure will be used in some of the structures here.

First structure: 2d Array of integers called sudoku which will hold the values that are inserted to the sudoku.

Second structure: An array of hashsets called squarePossibilitesCounter that will hold the rows and columns of each cell (frequency array):
the index in the array where the position(row and column) appeares at in the array, represents the number of possibilities that can be inserted in that cell. (e.g. if row 3 column 2 appeares in the hashset in index 4: there are 4 possibilities for insertion in that cell).
- This structure is used when guessing, it allowes searching the cell with the least amount of possibilities in faster times and is some sort of a substitute to naked groups.

Third structure: 2d array of Bitsets called squarePossibilities, where each cell in the array will hold the possibilities(values that are possible to insert in the cell) for the cell in the same position in the sudoku.
- This structure is not only used in most heuristics, but is the structure that is used to apply and save those heuristics (i will talk about specific heuristics in the end).
  
Fourth structure: An array of Bitsets called rowAvailability, An array of Bitsets called colAvailability,
An array of Bitsets called gridAvailability, each holding the possibilities that can be inserted (or were yet to be inserted) in their respected row, column or grid.
- Theese structures are used in the hidden groups heuristics, which will be mentioned in the end.

Fitfh structure: An Array of BitSets called fullRows and An Array of BitSets called fullCols. every BitSet in the array have values that represent a full row or column.
- Theese structures are used in pointing groups.

Sixth structure: 3 2d arrays of bitsets called rowAvailabilityCounter, colAvailabilityCounter and gridAvailabilityCounter
where each row index represents a row, column or grid respectively, and each column index represents a value from the possible value in the sudoku, and the values stored inside the array are the columns, row or positions respectively where they appear in the row, column or grid respectively.
**Explanation** i will take rowAvailabilityCounter for an example, the row index in the 2d array will represent the same row index in the sudoku, while the column index in the 2d array will represent a value from the values that are possible in the sudoku (e.g possible values in a sudoku for a 9X9 its 1-9). for example, if i will take rowAvailabilityCounter[3, 2] it will give me a BitSet that represents the columns where the value 2 in row 3 appears as a possibility (in reality its value 3 since index starts at 0).
or if i will take rowAvailabilityCounter[3,2] it will give me a BitSet that represents the rows where the value 2 in column 3 appears as a possibility.
- Theese structures are used in all heuristics, except for naked singles and minimum possibility insertions. and even more importantly they hint when to check for possible heuristics.

and lastly a stack of Guesses that hold the insertions and possibility removal between guesses.
- this allows the program to return to before the latest guess by readding all the removed possibilities and insertion from the latest Guess.

There are some more less important structures but those were the main ones.

**Heuristics:**
1. **Minimum possibility insertion**: Every time the program doesnt know for sure where to change the current state, and it has to guess an insertion, we put the insertion in the place with the least possible possibilities. this is done by using the frequency array(squarePossibilitesCounter) that holds the amount of possibilities corresponding to the index in the array, and inserting a value that is possible in the first cell we find.
2. **Naked singles**: a cell that has only one possible value, can only have this value. thus its garunteed to be there. this Heuristic is similar to the first one, but i added it because its very fast to implement and it minimizes recursion. every time you remove a possibility from a cell (from squarePossibilities) we just count the amount of possibilities left and if its one its a naked single and you insert it.
3. **Pointing groups**: if in  a grid, a value can only be inserted in one row or one column, it cannot be inserted in other grids in the same row or column. this check happens only when value appears less time in a grid then the grid width or height (the amount of possible positions in rowAvailabilityCounter[grid, value] is less the grid width or height). if a pointing group is found, you remove the values from the possibilities in the cells that appear in the same row or column in other grids.
4. **Hidden Singles**: if a value appears once as a possibility in a row, column or grind. it must be there and it needs to be inserted. this is how its done: every time a possibility is removed from a cell, if the number of appearances the value has in the same row(rowAvailabilityCounter[row, value].Count), column(colAvailabilityCounter[col, value].Count) or grid(gridAvailabilityCounter[grid ,value].Count) is one, its a hidden single and it must be inserted.
5. **Hidden Groups**: if X possible values have X cells they appear in and they appear only in those cells in the same row, column or grid, every single one of those X values must be in one of those X cells, and any other value has to be removed from the cells. for example: if 2 possible values(lets say 5 and 7) appears in 2 cells and only those cells in a certain row: 5 and 7 must be in those two cells, and any other possible values in those cells have to be removed. This is how its done: Every time we remove a possibility from a cell, we can count the amount of possibilities it has in the row(rowAvailabilityCounter[row, value].Count), column(colAvailabilityCounter[col, value].Count) or grid(gridAvailabilityCounter[grid ,value].Count) and if there are X values (where X is the amount of time the possibility appears in the row, column or grid) that appear only where the removed possibility appear(their positions are subsets of the value's position), they are hidden groups and numbers that arent in the group can be removed from the cells.
